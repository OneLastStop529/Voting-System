# Electronic Voting System

## Project Description
This electronic voting system will be a web-based application that will enable the voters to cast their vote privately through remote locations. The voting system will include the candidate information, voter details, the deadlines for casting votes and one person one vote concept. The authenticated voter (decided on the basis of voter id) will be able to enter the voting portal and cast their vote only once. It will be a user friendly application with not much front end authentication involved. The voter will be authenticated at the back end. Once the voting deadlines would be over, the final results would be declared on the portal.
